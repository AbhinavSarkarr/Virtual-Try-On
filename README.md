# Virtual-Try-On
This project implements a WhatsApp-based virtual try-on bot. The bot allows users to upload images via WhatsApp using Twilio and FastAPI, and with the help of a Gradio model, it processes the images to simulate virtual try-ons. Once processed, the bot sends the result back to the user through WhatsApp.
